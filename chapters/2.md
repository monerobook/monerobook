# How Monero works

## General Presentation of Monero Technologies ##

A blockchain, originally block chain, is a continuously growing list of records, called blocks, which are linked and secured using cryptography.

Each block typically contains a hash pointer as a link to a previous block, a timestamp and transaction data. By design, blockchains are inherently resistant to modification of the data.

It is "an open, distributed ledger that can record transactions between two parties efficiently and in a verifiable and permanent way". For use as a distributed ledger, a blockchain is typically managed by a peer-to-peer network collectively adhering to a protocol for validating new blocks. Once recorded, the data in any given block cannot be altered retroactively without the alteration of all subsequent blocks, which requires collusion of the network majority.

## Transaction

Each transaction within the Monero network has a set of inputs and outputs, where inputs consume Monero from the sender and outputs transfer them to the recipient.

The transaction is digitally signed by the sender, who authorizes the transfer of Monero. The transaction is then broadcasted to the network and grouped with several other transactions in the form of a block, which the network’s miners validate. For each input you'll have to pay a fee which goes to the miners, and in this way you incentivize participation in the mining process to further secure the network. Once the block is accepted, the transactions get recorded on the blockchain (which, as you may recall, is a public ledger) in chronological order. Whenever this process is successfully completed, the network distributes new Monero to miners for each block that has been solved/validated. This is referred to as a block reward.

## How Does Monero Work 

As we mentioned in Chapter 1, Monero is based on the CryptoNote protocol and utilizes the most powerful cryptographic techniques in an effort to protect the privacy of the sender, recipient, and obfuscate the amount transacted.

[[ Monero Scheme ]]

Below, you will be provided more detail on the underlying cryptographic techniques that Monero utilizes to ensure the privacy of every Monero user during the transaction process.

## How Monero Protects Your Privacy

## Stealth Addresses

What we have learnt is that Monero uses a distributed peer-to-peer consensus network to record transaction outputs on a blockchain. If Leo owns Monero, it means that he has exclusive control over some of these outputs. When Leo sends Monero to George, Leo is announcing to the network that he wishes to transfer the value of some of his outputs to a new output for George, which only he can control. In other words, a transaction is the transformation of old outputs belonging to one wallet into new outputs belonging to another. Let’s take this a step further, to see how stealth addresses enhance a user’s privacy.

In every transaction, a stealth address, also known as a one-time public key, is automatically generated and recorded as part of the transaction to indicate who can spend an output in a later transaction. An outside observer cannot tell if funds are moving from Leo to George nor link wallet addresses together by just looking at the blockchain. Therefore, when Leo sends Monero to George, the output George receives will not be publicly associated with George’s wallet address. However, if Leo ever needs to prove that he in fact sent Monero to George, his wallet has the ability to verify that payment was sent. George can rest assured that no one else can see when or if any Monero was sent to him.

If George were a merchant, this feature would be a great benefit, because no one can tell how many different customers he has, whether any of them are repeat customers, or if he has any customers at all.

A Monero wallet address is a 95-character string, which consists of a public view key and a public spend key. When Leo sends Monero to George, Leo’s wallet will use George’s public view key and public spend key as well as some random data to generate a unique onetime public key for George’s new output.

Everyone can see the one-time public key on the blockchain, but only Leo and George know that Leo sent Monero to George. The output is created in such a way that George is able to locate the output destined for him by scanning the blockchain with his wallet’s private view key. Once the output is detected and retrieved by George’s wallet, he would be able to calculate a one-time private key that corresponds with the one-time public key and spend the relevant output with his wallet’s private spend key.

This whole process occurs without ever having George’s wallet address publicly linked to any transaction. As you can see, stealth addresses prevent outputs from being associated with a recipient’s public address. This is accomplished by the use of one-time destination public keys. One-time public keys are only spendable by the recipient, and only the recipient is able to detect their designated output on the blockchain. Since all outputs are unlinkable, the privacy of the recipient is ensured. On the input side of the transaction, the sender’s privacy is protected with the use of ring signatures.

## Ring Signatures

A ring signature is a type of digital signature in which a group of possible signers are fused together to produce a distinctive signature that authorizes a transaction.

This is analogous to the signing of a check from a joint bank account, but with the actual signer remaining unknown. The digital signature is made up of the actual signer combined with non-signers to form a “ring,” where all members are equal and valid. The actual signer is a one-time spend key that corresponds with an output being spent from the sender’s wallet. The non-signers are past transaction outputs pulled from the blockchain, which act as decoys. These outputs together make up the inputs of a transaction.

To a third party, all of the inputs appear equally likely to be the output being spent in the transaction. This feature helps the sender hide the origin of the transaction, by making all inputs indistinguishable from each other.

You may now be asking yourself, “If there is no way for a third party to verify which output is being spent, what would prevent someone from spending the same output twice?” This potential issue is addressed by the use of “key images.” 

A key image is a cryptographic key derived from an output being spent and is made part of every ring signature transaction. Only one key image can exist for each output on the blockchain, yet due to its cryptographic properties, it is not possible to determine which output created which key image. A list of all used key images are maintained in the blockchain, enabling miners to verify that no outputs are spent twice. Let’s go through an example to see how all this works.

Leo wants to send Monero to George with a “ringsize” value of five. One of the five inputs will come from Leo’s wallet, which will be consumed in the transaction. The other four inputs are arbitrarily picked from the blockchain, and are used as decoys. This forms a group of five possible signers, where all ring members are plausibly the actual signer of the transaction. To an outside observer, including to George himself, it’s not clear which input was truly signed by Leo’s one-time spend key.

However, with the key image, the network is able to securely confirm that the Monero being transferred to George has not been spent before. As you can see, by using ring signatures, Monero protects the privacy of the sender by obscuring the source of inputs, and in doing so, ensures that the origin of any Monero remains untraceable.

Ring signatures protect senders’ privacy by preventing transaction inputs from being distinguishable from one another. This is accomplished by the use of digital signatures, where there is an actual signer hidden among multiple ring members to authorize a transaction. In addition, key images are used to prevent Monero inputs from being spent more than once. Ring signatures ensure privacy of the sender, since inputs are untraceable. To increase the privacy of both parties in a transaction, Ring Confidential Transactions (RingCT) has been implemented to hide transaction amounts.

## Ring Confidential Transactions Prior to the Implementation of RingCT

Monero required transaction amounts to be split into specific denominations. For example, an output of 12.5 Monero would be broken up into three separate rings in the amounts of 10, 2, and 0.5. This technique ensured that there would be ample ring members, since a ring signature could only ring together outputs of the same value.

However, a downside to this process is that an outside observer was able to see the amounts transacted. To address this shortcoming, Monero activated RingCT in January 2017. RingCT prevents privacy leaks by hiding transaction amounts in the blockchain.

A month after RingCT was activated approximately 98% of new transactions were using the RingCT protocol. After September 2017, the use of RingCT has become mandatory for all Monero transactions.

Today with RingCT, newly created Monero firstly resides in outputs that have visible amounts.

When new Monero is transferred for the first time, RingCT outputs with masked amounts are generated. As a result, transactions no longer need to be broken down into different denominations.

This means that a wallet is free to pick ring members from any RingCT outputs, which significantly improves privacy. It should be noted that Monero ring signatures cannot include both pre-RingCT outputs and masked RingCT outputs in a single ring. So, like newly created Monero, a pre-RingCT output must first be converted to a RingCT output before it can be included in a ring signature with other RingCT outputs. Let’s walk through an example and take a deep dive to see how RingCT works.

Leo has an output of 12.56 and would like to send George 2.5 Monero. Since outputs cannot be spent twice, Leo needs to spend the output in its entirety and return the change to himself. So, Leo’s transaction would have one input of 12.56 Monero and 2 outputs - one that is 2.5 Monero designated for George and another that is 10.06 Monero, which is sent back to his wallet as “change” of the transaction. To prove that Monero has not been fraudulently fabricated in a transaction, the sum of a transaction’s inputs must equal the sum of its outputs.

Due to cryptographic properties of RingCT, Leo is required to “commit” to the amount of an output, revealing just enough information for the network to confirm the transaction, while not publicly disclosing the amount he is spending. Although commitments look like random numbers, miners are still able to confirm that the amount of Monero being sent to George is the same as the amount of funds available.

Another important aspect of a RingCT transaction is the “range proof,” which prevents senders from committing to negative values in order to secure the supply of Monero. A range proof cryptographically proves the amounts used in a transaction is greater than 0 and less than some arbitrary number. While an outside observer is unable to see the actual amounts in outputs of a transaction, they are able to confirm that the transaction is a legitimate one that the network should accept.

Up to now, we have covered how Monero obfuscates information stored on the blockchain. Ring signatures protect the sender’s privacy, stealth addresses prevent outside observers from knowing the receiving address, and RingCT hides the amount of Monero that is transmitted. However, some personally identifiable information may be leaked at the network level when making a transaction. This privacy leak is addressed with Kovri.

## Kovri

Kovri is a free, decentralized, anonymity technology based on I2P’s open specifications. Kovri uses both encryption and sophisticated routing techniques to create a private overlay-network across the Internet. This protected overlay allows users to hide their geographical location and IP address. An IP address is like a home address for the Internet, so this is quite sensitive information, to say the least.

Let’s go through a few scenarios to see how this lightweight, security-focused software helps strengthen a user’s privacy.

Suppose Leo wants to send Monero to George. Leo’s wallet creates a transaction and then broadcasts it to the Monero network. The Monero network is made up of nodes that communicate with each other by directing messages using IP addresses. This means that it might be possible to geographically trace data as it travels over the open Internet, from start to finish and everywhere in between. Even though the sender’s and recipient’s wallet addresses - as well as the amount of Monero sent - remain private, Leo is taking a risk in broadcasting his transaction as some nodes may be logging IP addresses.

An adversary with enough resources could attempt to associate transactions with IP addresses to determine from where transactions originate. This could potentially lead to an adversary not relaying his transactions to the rest of the network or even worse, arriving at his front door.

Now let’s imagine a different scenario. Suppose Justin wants to support the Monero network by running a full node at his home. After a few weeks, he receives a cease and desist letter from his Internet Service Provider claiming that running a node is a violation of the terms of service. Or consider this, suppose David is an operator of a mining pool that donates a portion of block rewards to a political party or controversial cause. Other nodes could purposefully reject his solved blocks to express their disagreement with his political or social views.

Leo, George, Justin, and David all have at least one thing in common: their IP addresses were exposed. Users could try to hide IP addresses with the Tor or a VPN; however both of these strategies have serious weaknesses. The Tor network has “semi-trusted” Directory Authorities, which give a handful of Tor node operators overreaching influence into network consensus. Network consensus ultimately determines who is allowed to relay traffic on the Tor network based on the views of the Authorities. Furthermore, correlation attacks are easily possible with trusted VPNs, making it easy for large attackers to de-anonymize a user’s traffic.

So what can Leo, George, Justin, and David do to mitigate these threats? They could use Kovri. If they exclusively use Kovri to connect to the Monero network, no one will know their IP address, making passive surveillance impractical, while substantially improving Monero’s censorship resistance.

As you can see, Kovri is software that allows users to send transactions more privately than ever before. Let’s next go over some technical details to have a better understanding of how Kovri works under the hood.

Kovri tunnels traffic through the I2P network utilizing “garlic encryption” and “garlic routing”. Information travels within a private overlay-network by way of messages, which are encrypted in layers each time the message is passed along to peers in the network, similar to a Matryoshka doll. For each inner doll there is a lock and public key to the next doll. Peers in the network are not able to read the contents of the message being relayed, so information sent from the sender to its destination (and vice-versa) are secured. The only information visible to peers is the instruction for sending messages to the next peer. To achieve greater privacy at a slight cost to performance, users are able to connect to several peers. Essentially, Kovri covers an application’s Internet traffic to make it anonymous within the network.

Given this characteristic, Kovri is a great solution for anonymously communicating over IRC, email, or accessing hidden services. Kovri will revolutionize peer-to-peer connections and increase network resiliency and privacy worldwide. Malicious nodes can no longer threaten users who create transactions or block them from propagating across the network. Kovri will come bundled with future Monero releases and be enabled by default. In addition, Kovri will feature a common API that would allow other cryptocurrencies and applications to use it, not just Monero.

So, as you can see, every Monero transaction, by default, obfuscates the sender, recipient, amount transacted, and (soon) will hide users’ geographical location and IP address. This “always-on” privacy means that every Monero user’s activity enhances the privacy of all other users, unlike selectively transparent cryptocurrencies (e.g. Zcash).

Lastly, by virtue of obfuscation, Monero cannot become tainted through participation in previous transactions. This means Monero is fungible and will always be accepted without the risk of censorship.

## Monero is Fungible

If something is fungible, it is easily exchangeable or substitutable. Many commonly traded commodities are fungible. Any given ton of copper can be exchanged for a different ton of copper, or a barrel of oil for another barrel of oil.

The cleanest example of a fungible object is money. A dollar is a dollar is a dollar, whether you received it as a gift, found it on the floor, or earned it by working. A dollar is also a dollar whether it’s a dollar bill in your wallet, four quarters in a bowl of loose change, or a number on the screen when you check your bank balance online. It all has the same value. Money is fungible.

Now, let’s compare Bitcoin and Monero in terms of fungibility. In this comparison, transaction history will play an important role.

Bitcoin is not considered fungible, because its transparent blockchain allows anyone to trace where a Bitcoin came from. Let’s assume that you legally received a Bitcoin that had been used, previously, in a nefarious transaction. When that Bitcoin arrives in your wallet, it would be possible to look into the transaction of that specific Bitcoin and detect whether or not it had been used for an illicit activity. If that Bitcoin was used for such an act, it could be deemed as “dirty” and could be blacklisted by a merchant that accepts Bitcoin or even an exchange where you could trade that Bitcoin for another cryptocurrency.

In other words, a Bitcoin leaves a trace on the blockchain. A so-called “clean” Bitcoin is worth slightly more than any other coin on the network, as it has no history linking ownership of the Bitcoin to a specific wallet address that could have possibly been used in a nefarious transaction.

As you are aware, Monero has an opaque blockchain: the transaction history of a Monero cannot be looked up or investigated, so one Monero will always be equal to one Monero. As noted above, by virtue of obfuscation, Monero cannot become tainted through participation in previous transactions. This means Monero is fungible and will always be accepted without the risk of censorship.

As of today, no other privacy-focused cryptocurrency has the property of fungibility worked out as well as Monero. Simply put: This is the case, because Monero is private by default while other cryptocurrencies are optionally private (e.g. Zcash).
