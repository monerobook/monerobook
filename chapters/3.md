## Getting started
### Understanding Monero

If you think Monero is a new food, please read the section What is Monero.

### Container of Moneroj: Monero Wallets

A Monero wallet is a secure and private digital wallet used to store, send and receive Monero cryptocurrency. A Monero wallet uses the Monero Blockchain in order to protect your transactions and the wallet itself.

Here are some types of wallets:

- Cold Wallets

Cold wallets are offline wallets running on desktops environments (Windows, Mac OS and Linux-based systems). With a strong setup (including a firewall, an antivirus), they could be the most secure and private way for storing Monero.

- Mobile wallets

Mobile wallets are the wallets that running on Android, iOS, or other mobile systems. In fact, there are a few wallets built by trusted community users. Those can be the easiest solution for opening a Monero address, however not the most secure!

- Web wallets

Web wallets are wallets that are running on third-party services and you will have the control by a web-based services. As they can technically be used as mobile wallets, they could be the easiest solution for final users however the worst option for protecting your privacy; web wallets can track your ip and they could log personal data. Trusted web wallets use complex cryptography using the client of user in order to protect the wallets. Third party services shouldn't have the private key, use web wallets only if you don't have a good platform for another wallet!

- Hardware wallets

Hardware wallets are special wallets which store the Monero wallet in a secure hardware device. This way is the best for users that want their Monero wallet in every personal computer. There is an entire section about it: go to 10th chapter for more information.

TIP:

The best choice is to run Monero on linux based systems: Windows and Mac OS X aren't open sourced so no one can guarantee you they don't have any backdoors. As a developer, you should use the shell in order to fully and correctly understand Monero.
Monero Tools for Windows, Mac and Linux system

- Monero Daemon called `monerod` : it manages the Monero blockchain
- Monero Wallet Graphical User Interface called `monero-wallet-gui`: a simple GUI client for managing Monero wallets
- Monero Wallet Command Line Interface
- Monero Wallet Remote Procedural Call (called monero-wallet-rpc): a helpful piece of software that creates an API in order to talk to Monero wallets. A lot of web services are based on the Monero Wallet RPC.

### How to use Monero GUI (Graphical User Interface)

1. Open Monero daemon (called monerod);
2. Wait for blocks synchronization (it can take 1-2 days);
3. Open Monero Wallet GUI (called monero-wallet-gui);
4. Select the language;
5. Option "Create a wallet";
6. Enter the name of wallet: you can enter anything for the name of the wallet. This name will not be shared with anyone else, so entering your real name will not be a privacy leak.  Monero Wallet GUI will print to screen a SEED, that's is important in case of restoring a wallet, so you shouldn't share the seed with others;
7. Type the password; Same as name of wallet, you can enter anything;
8. Yay! You have a Monero public address!

### How to use Monero Wallet CLI (Command Line Interface)

The command line for Monero could be the best option to manage in a fast way your monero as an advanced user.

1. Open Monero daemon (called monerod);
2. Wait for blocks synchronization (it could take 1-2 days);
3. Open Monero wallet cli (called monero-wallet-cli, see available flag for more informations );

```
Monero 'Helium Hydra' (v0.11.1.0-release)
Logging to ./monero-wallet-cli.log
Specify wallet file name (e.g., MyWallet). If the wallet doesn't exist, it will be created.
Wallet file name (or Ctrl-C to quit):
```

4. You will have two option: creating a wallet or opening a wallet. Just text the wallet name, there are two options: if the wallet exists, monero wallet cli will try to open it by asking to user a password.

```
Wallet and key files found, loading...
Wallet password: Digit here
```

and..

```
Opened wallet: MONERO_ADDRESS
**********************************************************************
Use "help" command to see the list of available commands.
**********************************************************************
Starting refresh...
Height 319911 / 1466049
```

Block synchronization is very IMPORTANT: monero wallet cli will scan every blocks in order to find any transactions for your wallet. That's means: if you haven't got a connection to the daemon, you will see the balance at 0.

If you haven't a wallet, you have to create a new one by answering yes to the "Would you like to create a new wallet?" question. It will create a new wallet and it will prompt you a password. After that, it will print a mnemonic seed, that's important and you mustn't give the mnemonic seed, nobody will ask you it! Keep it in a secure place, when you have fully control (I wouldn't like to suggest emails and servers).

5. Text the password and the language
6. Yay! You have a Monero public address!

### How to Get Monero

* BUYING

The easiest way for getting Monero is purchasing them from final users. Helpful websites like localmonero.co might help you. Some users might not provide you Moneroj after payment with payment processor (paypal, bills, stripe..), these users are called scammer, avoid them.

* EXCHANGE

Cryptocurrency exchanges are online platforms where you can exchange one cryptocurrency for another cryptocurrency (or for fiat currency). In other words, depending on the exchange, it is either like a stock exchange or a currency exchange (at the airport or bank) This is probably the most used way: simply, if you have another cryptocoin like Bitcoin, you can get Monero by exchange. They are basically online wallets, so take some consideration when you are using those.

* MINING

Monero is a proof of work (as know as PoW) cryptocurrency that can be miner with computational power from a CPU or GPU. There are currently no ASICs for Monero, which means that anyone with a computer can mine it. The first thing you need to think about is if you are going to mine solo or on a pool. Mining on a pool usually comes with a fee however also has it's advantages. Users that don't have enough computational power may have to wait long periods of time before getting a reward, in a pool users pull their efforts together in order to reduce variance and have a steady flow of income. Users that have enough hardware or simply want to mine solo can also benefit from solo pools which function in the same way as normal solo mining, however don't require users to run a full node or store the entire blockchain.


### Problems

As always, you may ecounter errors. Here is the solution to some common issues

I transferred an amount to my monero wallet, but my balance is 0. Monero is a scam!!!

(First of all, I would like to mark a concept: Monero is not a scam, there was no Initial Coin Offerring (also known as an ICO) and there was zero premine. Comment: Should I mark that on first chapter?)

Solution:

- Check if you copied the correct Monero Address
- Verify whether the transaction actually arrived at your wallet / address using the following steps

1. Go to the Settings page of the GUI and press on Show seed & keys. Subsequently, copy the private view key.
2. Go to xmrchain.net blockexplorer
3. Enter your transaction ID / hash.
4. Now search the page for Decode outputs.
5. Enter your private view key. In addition, enter your address in the second box.
6. Press on decode outputs.
7. If it shows "output true" it proves you correctly received your XMR.

Check if you are connected to the blockchain (either by using a remote node or a local monero daemon) If this checks out it's most likely a visibility bug: Monero wallet graphical user uses a cache (especially on windows) and sometimes it could take a few seconds in order to refresh the local cache. If this problem, persists

### Monero wallet is so slow

Using a non-performant computer, Monero wallet GUI and wallet cli could be slow. If you don't want to use your computer as a node, you can connect your Monero wallet to a remote node.

### How to connect to the node from Monero GUI

After you enter your password for your wallet, you will see a pop up that will give you the option to "use custom settings". Click on it. You will then be sent to the "Settings" page in the GUI. At this point you should see two text boxes to the right of a label that says "Daemon address". In the first box (the on to the left) you need to enter the address of the node that you want to connect to.

This address might look like node.moneroworld.com or it could look like any old ip address. The smaller box to the right is where you enter the node's port. The default port is 18081 but if you are using a random node the port that is used will vary. The port for node.moneroworld.com uses 18089.
