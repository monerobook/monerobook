# How Monero works

The first two chapters covered everything you need to know about WHY to use Monero (Chapter 1) and HOW to use Monero (Chapter 2). By now, you have learned everything necessary to begin using Monero yourself!

The rest of this book contains extra details, for those wishing to dive deeper into how Monero works “behind the scenes.” Chapters 3 and 4 describe underlying technologies such as Monero's privacy features, the blockchain, and the mining process - focusing on understanding the concepts, without digressing into the advanced mathematics. Later chapters contain those nitty-gritty details for developers and cryptography geeks.

## 3.1 Transaction and the Ledger

To set the stage for understanding Monero's privacy technologies, we will consider how moneroj are sent and received on the ledger. For this chapter, we will focus on blockchain functionality - its role as an inherently tamper-proof shared database that keeps a list of Monero transactions. The details about blockchain security (mining, hashes, etc) are another topic, reserved for Chapter 4.

When you set up a wallet for the first time, it generates a new seed that you will keep secret and use to access your moneroj on the blockchain. This initialization process is carried out on your device, and can be executed entirely offline; nothing is broadcast to, or recorded by, the network during wallet generation.

Behind the scenes, your wallet calculates two sets of keys from your seed. Your private keys are a closely-guarded secret, since you use them to prove your identity and access your moneroj. Your public keys are, as the name implies, made known to other Monero users. Public and private keys are generated together as sets, with particular mathematical properties that create a special link between the keys.

To receive moneroj, you give your address (created from your public keys) to the sender. When somebody (a customer, an exchange, or a friend) sends you Monero, they will broadcast a transaction that transfers some of their moneroj into a new entry on the ledger that you (and only you) can unlock with your private keys.

In technical lingo, the output of their transaction is stored on the blockchain for you to access and spend with your private keys, at your leisure. This terminology can be a bit confusing, since the cryptocurrency use of the word “output” has a different meaning than its typical definition.

Each time you receive moneroj, you gain another output; each time you spend moneroj, you use up one of your outputs and generate a new one for somebody else. In fact, all of the moneroj that you “own” are simply outputs on the blockchain that your private keys unlock. Until somebody sends you moneroj, there will not be any outputs on the blockchain that are associated with, or accessible by, your private keys.

When your wallet is scanning or syncing this usually means that it is using your private keys to check all of the transactions and outputs on the blockchain to identify relevant entries. Your wallet balance is the total sum of these outputs that your private keys can unlock and spend.

When you send moneroj from your wallet, you use up some of your outputs as inputs to a transaction that you broadcast to the network. Conceptually, the blockchain is simply a record of these transactions, each consuming the sender's outputs as inputs, to generate a new output for the recipient.

The process described above is slightly simplified, to convey the crucial parts (private/public keys, transactions, inputs/outputs). The following sections provide non-technical explanations of the key concepts underlying Monero's suite of privacy features.

## 3.2 Privacy Technology Overview

The general principles and terminology introduced above are shared by most cryptocurrencies. Monero provides enhanced functionality and privacy through several unique cryptographic technologies that shield the users and their activity from public visibility. 
Figure 3.1 shows how these complementary features work together to protect sensitive transaction details:

* RingCT conceals the transaction amount.
* Ring signatures protect the sender by obfuscating which output was spent.
* Stealth address ensure that the recipient's address is not recorded on the blockchain.
* Kovri breaks the link between your transactions and physical location by obfuscating the broadcast origin and concealing network signs of Monero activity.

### 3.2.1 Ring Confidential Transaction

RingCT is a cryptographic technology that conceals the amount of moneroj being sent in any transaction. With most cryptocurrencies, transaction amounts are sent in cleartext, visible to any observer. RingCT keeps this sensitive information private by allowing the sender to prove that they have enough moneroj for a transaction, without revealing the value of that amount! This is possible thanks to cryptographic commitments and range proofs.

When you send moneroj, you “commit” the amount in a private way, revealing just enough information for the network to confirm the legitimacy of the transaction, while not publicly disclosing the amount itself. A valid commitment guarantees that the transaction is not fraudulently creating or overspending moneroj.

Range proofs are another important mechanism in RingCT, as a method to ensure that the committed amount is greater than zero, and less than a certain number. This is necessary to prevent senders from committing negative or impossibly-high amounts of moneroj. Together, commitments and range proofs secure the supply of moneroj against fraudulent manipulation and counterfeiting attempts.

Prior to RingCT, Monero transactions were partitioned into specific denominations (for example, 12.5 XMR would be sent as 10 XMR + 2 XMR + 0.5 XMR) and the transaction amounts were visible to outside observers.  RingCT was activated in January 2017, and rapid widespread adoption immediately followed. Within 1 month of its activation, approximately 98% of new transactions were already voluntarily using the RingCT protocol!

In keeping with Monero's policy of enforced privacy-by-default, RingCT became mandatory for all Monero transactions after September 2017. To spend any old pre-RingCT outputs, they must first be converted to RingCT outputs with masked amounts.

### 3.2.2 Stealth (one-time) addresses

All Monero transactions utilize stealth addresses to protect the privacy of the recipient. To avoid recording the recipient's wallet address onto the blockchain, each Monero transaction is instead sent to a unique disposable one-time address. The recipient can access funds sent to a stealth address, without exposing any links to their wallet's public addresses or other transactions.

[![Figure 3.2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/monerobook/monerobook/master/resources/img/mm-c03i04%20stealth%20address.png)](https://masteringmonero.com)

To conceptualize the use of random one-time codes to protect the recipient's identity, imagine that you wish to give a few books about coping with a sensitive illness to your friend André. Unfortunately you're about to leave town for a trip and André won't be around until next week. Perhaps you could ask your friendly neighbor to temporarily hold onto the books and pass them forward to the recipient.

Your neighbor will need to verify that anybody attempting to claim the books is actually the intended recipient. Since your friend is a private person with a sensitive condition, it would be inappropriate to tell your neighbor to check their ID for the name “André”. How could you arrange the exchange while preserving André's privacy? You could simply make up a one-time random code and tell your neighbor to give the books to whoever presents that code (e.g. give these books to the person who knows the phrase “PolarComboTango357”). Your neighbor will be able to keep track of the books and give them to André, without learning anything about their recipient.

Similar to the way you might use that random non-informative code to keep your neighbor from learning about your books' recipient, Monero uses a system of one-time codes to prevent the network from learning about Monero recipients! Instead of explicitly recording the recipient's address on the blockchain (analogously, “give the books to André”), funds are always sent to a one-time “stealth address” (analogously, “give these books to the person who knows the phrase PolarComboTango357”). The cryptographic techniques that secure stealth addresses solely for the recipient are discussed in chapter 5, however the salient points are detailed below.

How are these one-time addresses generated? Your Monero wallet's public addresses are 95-character strings, which incorporate two public keys (the public view and public spend keys) mathematically derived from your seed. When somebody sends you funds, they will use the public keys in your address along with some random data to generate a unique one-time public key. These one-time public keys that are recorded in transactions on the blockchain are named stealth addresses because it is impossible for the network or an outside observer to connect these random codes back to the originating wallets.

[![Figure 3.3](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/monerobook/monerobook/master/resources/img/mm-c03i02%20donation.png)](https://masteringmonero.com)

Note that subaddresses are not the same as stealth addresses. Subaddresses are reusable public wallet addresses that are not recorded in the blockchain. Multiple transactions sent to a single subaddress will all point to different and unlinkable stealth addresses.

Improved privacy by not recording wallet addresses on the blockchain is a clear benefit of implementing stealth addresses. An even bigger implication is that use of these unique one-time keys prevents multiple payments to the same address from being linked together!

Suppose you create some public art and post an address for cryptocurrency donations. If you use a coin with a transparent blockchain (e.g. Bitcoin), then every incoming transaction to that address is permanently recorded in searchable linkable form. Anybody can use a blockchain explorer to see how many Bitcoin donations you received, their amount, and whether or not you've moved the funds. Every incoming Bitcoin transaction is indexed on the ledger by the address that you shared publicly.

If you post a Monero address instead, your donations are not exposed to public scrutiny. Each donor will generate a unique one-time stealth address, and record that on the ledger. The public donation address that you posted next to your project will never be directly referenced in a transaction, and the stealth addresses do not provide any information about the recipient. Since each donor mixes in their own random information to create the stealth address for their transaction, one donor cannot recognize a stealth address generated by another.
All Monero transactions must use stealth addresses, to ensure privacy for the entire network. Your wallet automatically creates the stealth address from the public address when it generates the transaction.

### 3.2.3 Ring Signatures

Ring signatures are a Monero feature designed to protect a transaction's sender by obfuscating the source of the moneroj being spent. Before jumping into ring signatures, we'll introduce the concept of digital signatures in general.

Digital signatures are a general cryptographic method for confirming the authenticity and source of data or a message. The signatures can be checked against the public key to confirm the identity of the signer, and verify that the signed message is complete and unmodified. If the signed data is changed by even a single character (whether due to intentional tampering or accidental miscommunication) the signature will be rendered invalid.

Varying implementations of digital signatures are a key component of all cryptocurrencies. To spend one of your outputs, you compose a message to the network describing the transaction, sign it with your corresponding private key, then broadcast the result to the network. Before executing the transaction, the network checks the validity of the signature to verify that the message has not been altered, and/or forged, by a third party that does not possess the correct private key.

With transparent cryptocurrencies (e.g. Bitcoin) each message describing a transaction explicitly declares which outputs are being spent. This is useful for easy bookkeeping, since the network simply maintains a record of unspent transaction outputs (UTXOs) that are considered as valid inputs for new transactions. If somebody attempts to spend the same Bitcoin output twice, the fraudulent second transaction is promptly rejected, since the network knows that the owner already spent that output (when they signed and broadcast the first transaction). Unfortunately, this straightforward proof of ownership is highly detrimental to privacy by definitively indicating the source of funds, and indicating when a given output is spent.

Monero uses a different scheme, known as ring signatures. This group-signing method allows one member to digitally sign the message on behalf of the group, while mixing in the public keys of the other members, so that it is unclear who actively signed the message. It is possible to cryptographically verify that one of the ring members signed the message, but impossible to determine which of the members actually crafted the signature.

Ring signatures are used in Monero to blend the keys from multiple outputs on the blockchain, in order to obfuscate which output is actually being spent. Suppose Maria wants to spend one of her Monero outputs. Her wallet will semi-randomly select several other past outputs on the blockchain (not belonging to Maria) and mix their public keys into the ring signature as decoys. The network is able to verify that one of the outputs is being spent, however the decoys and true spender are cryptographically indistinguishable.

Ring signatures protect the sender in all transactions, since the recipient and Monero network are unable to ascertain which ring member is the true source of the funds. A significant consequence of ring signatures is that an outside observer is unable to definitively prove that an output has been spent! The fact that an output appears in a ring signature is entirely inconclusive, since it is impossible to distinguish whether it was truly being spent, or simply passively employed as a decoy ring member.

Since it is impossible to tell whether a particular output has been spent, you might be wondering what prevents an unscrupulous user from trying to spend the same output twice? With one-output-one-spend transparent blockchains (e.g. Bitcoin) this is a trivial task: any output that has been cryptographically signed and transferred once is marked as spent and cannot be used again. However, Monero outputs can appear in ring signatures before and after they have been spent, so output reuse must be prevented by other means.

This is accomplished by utilizing key images that are generated and recorded with each transaction, uniquely derived from the actual output being spent. The network cannot ascertain which ring member is connected to the key image; however other participants only need to check whether or not the key image has been used before. If a malicious user attempts to spend the same output twice, it generates the same key image both times, and the network instantly rejects the fraudulent second transaction. Thanks to key images, the network can prevent output reuse, despite not knowing which outputs are spent!

[![Figure 3.4](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/monerobook/monerobook/master/resources/img/mm-c03i03%20ring%20signature.png)](https://masteringmonero.com)

The Monero network originally did not mandate ring signatures, which unfortunately allowed privacy-damaging zero-mixin transactions with no decoys. These early transactions had the same structure and weaknesses as transparent blockchains, by unequivocally identifying both the sender and receiver, along with revealing when the output is spent. Starting in 2016, the network began requiring two ring members for each signature, enforcing privacy-by-default for the sender. This was raised to a minimum ring size of five plausible signers in late 2017, and increased again to a minimum of seven potential signers in early 2018.

Note that between 2016 and 2018, ring size policies were formulated as a minimum number of mix-ins, and users were allowed to create transactions with larger rings if they desired. On paper, one might think that using more decoys in a transaction guarantees more privacy. However, there is a practical issue to take into consideration - when the vast majority of transactions use the minimum ring size, larger custom ring sizes stand out as unusual, which is counterproductive for privacy.

This was addressed in the late 2018 network upgrade; instead of specifying a minimum ring size, network policies now mandate a fixed ring size. At the time of writing, all transactions must use ring signatures with exactly eleven members. This number may increase in the future, as research into statistical threat models and best privacy practices continues to evolve.

### 3.2.4 Kovri & Traffic Analysis
Any device connected to the internet is assigned an IP address as an identifier to help route traffic to the correct user. However, this IP address can easily be connected to a user's physical location and identity.

The ability to link Monero activity and transactions to IP addresses has several significant downsides. Some of the cryptographic measures described in the previous section to protect Monero users may be partially circumvented if the IP addresses from node connection logs are analyzed to identify Monero users.

It is worth considering the unfortunate scenarios that can arise when Monero network activity is connected to physical location and identity.

Since broadcasting to the Monero network reveals an IP address, a node receiving a transaction may be able to identify the physical location of the sender. While Monero's other privacy features make it difficult to link transactions from blockchain data alone, surveilling node(s) that observe multiple transactions originating from the same IP address could infer that they may be connected.

In addition to these privacy concerns, exposed IP addresses also enable potential censorship.  A malicious node might choose to not relay transactions from certain individuals or groups. Even worse, the geographic information revealed by IP addresses might lead adversaries pay a malicious visit to cryptocurrency users' doorsteps.

The connection between IP addresses and Monero activity is not only a threat for the users broadcasting transactions. The network traffic through nodes is currently visible to internet service providers and other surveilling parties, which could put node owners at risk if their government or internet service provider chooses to respond negatively toward cryptocurrencies.

Cryptocurrency miners may also experience unfair treatment if their IP addresses are connected to their network activity. Malicious parties might seek attack certain miners by censoring their blocks, perhaps due to some ideological disagreement, or to limit non-government or non-corporate mining.

Clearly, all parties in the Monero ecosystem benefit from the decoupling of their network activity from their IP addresses (and thus their physical location/identity). There are currently several ways to achieve this type of privacy, if you are in a situation where you must conceal your use of Monero on a monitored connection.

One option is a virtual private network (VPN) to send your traffic through an encrypted connection that your internet service provider and government cannot surveil. This works by establishing a secure tunnel between you and the VPN servers, so your traffic is mixed with other users' data and broadcast from a different IP address. Note that the service providing your VPN could be keeping logs, so be sure to exercise due diligence and use a trustworthy company.

Another option is to use The Onion Router ("Tor") to route your traffic through a private network of relay nodes. Tor was originally developed by the United States Naval Research Laboratory, and is used by journalists, intelligence agencies, and those who must take extra steps to avoid surveillance or censorship. Tor is a free decentralized open-source private network designed so that no participants can identify the source of any particular broadcast. Tor can be accessed through a dedicated browser, and users with strong privacy needs can use a Linux distribution, such as Whonix, that routes all traffic through Tor.

The Monero community has also supported the development of Kovri, a privacy approach based on the decentralized Invisible Internet Project (I2P) specifications. Kovri is being designed to use encryption and sophisticated routing techniques to create a private network distributed across the internet, available for other applications as well.

Until Kovri or a similar feature is directly integrated into Monero, any users with particular concerns about internet traffic analysis are encouraged to use a Tor or a reliable VPN provider to keep their connections and IP address concealed.

## 3.3 Concluding comments

Monero uses several unique privacy technologies to protect various elements of the network and all parties in all transactions. RingCT conceals the amount sent in each transaction. Ring signatures protect the sender by concealing the source of the funds, while stealth addresses ensure that the recipient's address is not recorded on the blockchain. Kovri is an upcoming routing technology that breaks the link between your Monero activity, and your physical location/identity.

Together, these features ensure that Monero users remain anonymous, and that funds are not trackable. By cryptographically eliminating all the links used in analyzing transactions on the blockchain, Monero achieves fungibility, which is a necessary characteristic of practical currencies. Now that you have read this chapter, you can understand how Monero protects the individuals described in the use cases described in chapter 1.
