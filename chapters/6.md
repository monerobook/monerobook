## Principles of openness

While the Monero cryptocurrency itself epitomizes privacy, its community is built on transparency and collaboration! Users, developers, and researchers communicate on IRC channels open to the public, and key meetings are archived for public view on the official website.

This culture of cooperation and openness is a natural consequence of Monero’s origin as a fork from ByteCoin. The developer of ByteCoin operated with unilateral secrecy, making designs and decisions without community feedback. The resulting development mistakes, especially the egregious premine, ruined the viability of the coin. 

The Monero community came into existence by forking the shadowy ByteCoin development into the light of a decentralized, collaborative, and diverse community. This has undoubtedly strengthened the project on many fronts, and the Monero community has learned to thrive on cooperation. Cryptography may be the underpinning of Monero, but the community is its real source of power!

## Many great minds work on Monero

The Monero project is a massive community effort, assembled by hundreds of people. At the time of writing, more than 500 individuals have contributed code, including 200 in the last year. Monero has adopted an “un-governance” scheme for organizing growth and development. The project is comprised of several different “branches” working together: the community, the Monero Core Team, the Monero Research Lab, and Monero Workgroups.

The Monero Research Lab conducts cutting-edge basic and applied research on cryptocurrency technologies and analyses. MRL includes many academics and researchers, and studies are published openly at https://lab.getmonero.org/

The Monero Core Team manages many of the critical tasks for Monero. The Core team is tasked to: 

* Act as primary trusted arbiters of the Forum Funding System on behalf of the community, so as to ensure the completion of all projects to the satisfaction of the community.

* Manage the codebase of the Monero Project, which includes merging code, keeping backups, and ensuring the safety, security, and free access of the code from any party.

* Steward the general donation fund, and spending the Monero there on anything they see fit to further the Monero Project.

* Act as trusted signers and distributors of reference clients for the Monero coin, and other related technologies. Set a direction and vision for the Monero Project, which is deliberated in the community.

The Monero Workgroups are collaborations formed to join people around unique goals. This allows small teams of individuals to connect and tackle specific tasks. For example, the Monero Hardware Workgroup is well underway on its mission to build the first open-source community-driven hardware wallet. Another instance was the Monero Integrations Workgroup that developed free open-source payment gateways. You can join a workgroup to help with translating Monero, crafting kits for Meetups or helping users with software issues. 

The community is what makes Monero possible! Anybody is welcome to contribute code, propose projects, fund proposals, help with outreach, or write books about Monero.

## Contributing to the Monero Codebase

### Make a pull request for the improvements

Anyone is welcome to contribute to Monero’s codebase! If you have a fix or code change, feel free to submit it as a pull request directly to the “master” branch. In cases where the change is relatively small or does not affect other parts of the codebase it may be merged in immediately by any one of the collaborators. On the other hand, if the change is particularly large or complex, it is expected that it will be discussed at length. To do this:

1. Fork the repository 
2. Clone the repo to your machine
3. Make a branch, make necessary changes, and commit the files with a clear commit message
4. Push your changes to your fork by running the command git push origin branch-name
5. Go to your fork to see a Compare and pull request button
6. Add necessary details and documentation

When submitting a pull request, make sure your branch is rebased. No merge commits nor stray commits from other people in your submitted branch, please. You may be asked to rebase if there are conflicts (even trivially resolvable ones).

### Patch etiquette

Patches are preferably to be sent via a pull request. If that can’t be done, patches in “git format-patch” format can be sent (eg, posted to fpaste.org with a long enough timeout and a link posted to #monero-dev on irc.freenode.net).

Patches should be self contained. A good rule of thumb is to create one patch per separate issue, feature, or logical change. Also, do not make other changes, such as random whitespace changes or reindentation. Please follow the code style of the particular chunk of code that you’re modifying. Proper squashing should be done (e.g. if you’re code a buggy patch followed by a subsequent patch to fix that bug, then both patches should be merged).

### General guidelines

Commit messages should be sensible. That means a subject line that describes the patch, with an optional longer body that gives details, documentation, etc. Well-commented code is strongly encouraged, to help others interpret and constructively interact with your code. If you’re adding some new functionality, testing results are helpful to include with your pull request.

If you’ve made random unrelated changes (including those due to an overzealous editor), you can select which changes go into the coming commit using git add -p, steps through each of the changes to verify which should be included. This helps create clean patches without any irrelevant changes. git diff displays changes in your tree, and git diff --cached will show the changes that are currently staged for commit. Hunks that are added with git add -p, will “move” from the git diff output to the git diff --cached output, so you can see clearly what your commit is going to look like.

More specific guidelines regarding common processes are described here: https://github.com/monero-project/monero/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md

## Introduction to Monero Core code

Many different repositories are hosted at the Monero Project GitHub [link: https://github.com/monero-project/]. Several of them house components that we’ve already discussed in Mastering Monero, for example:

* monero: the core of Monero network, written in C++ language
* monero-GUI: Graphical User Interface for Monero, built with Qt library
* monero-CLI: the CLI for Monero (included in the Monero-core repository)
* monero-site: the website for Monero: https://getmonero.org
* sekura: the community hardware wallet
* kovri: The Kovri anonymizing router

These projects are well-documented, so that you can become familiar with the code and make improvements! You can see that there are lots of different sub-projects with opportunities for you to contribute to Monero. Please visit one of the repositories, read through some of the open issues, and consider how you can leave your legacy in the Monero codebase.

## Introduction to Monero Development

Building the Monero code is a complex process, so some tips and summaries are included here. Linux systems have a built-in shell that helps with building the Monero core, so consider switching to a *nix-based operating system, if possible. Monero is written in C++, with C++11-style referenciation.

### Downloading the Monero Source Code

Monero uses Git as the version control system. This allows developers to track changes and modifications to their code, and coordinate work on shared files. To download the Monero code, simply execute

git clone https://github.com/monero-project/monero

### Dependencies

To build Monero software from the source code, your path will need to include the dependencies in the table below. A few of the libraries are also included in this repository (marked as “Vendored”). By default, the build uses the library installed on the system, and ignores the vendored sources. However, if no library is found installed on the system, then the vendored source will be built and used. The vendored sources are also used for statically-linked builds because distribution packages often include only shared library binaries (.so) but not static library archives (.a).

### Building Instruction

Monero uses the CMake build system and a top-level makefile that invokes cmake commands, as needed. Once you’ve installed the dependences, change to the root of the source code directory and execute the make command to begin the build. The process may take up to an hour or two. Once the code has finished building, you can find the Monero binaries in the /build/release/bin folder. 

### Build Troubleshooting

If you run into errors, the output will likely indicate exactly what went wrong. A few of the common bugs to troubleshoot include:

* An outdated boost version (you may have to manually install the current one)
* Outdated gcc/g++
* Missing libzmq3-dev
* Missing libreadline-dev
* OpenGL errors

You can (optionally) type make debug to compile a debugging build. There are many communities with information to help you with troubleshooting. Search engine queries with your build errors are likely to connect you with a solution or people that can help. 

### Top-level folders

* cmake:  contains compiling rules for the cmake build system.

* contrib

* external: external libraries from open source projects

* include: internal libraries

* src: the main source code for Monero

* translations: folder for translations

* tests: unit tests for Monero

* utils: utilities for Monero code (gpg keys, scripts for build translations)

## Building Monero Graphical User Interface

The Monero graphical user interface (GUI) is built with C++ and Qt libraries. Both are necessary to successfully build the GUI. With the dependencies in place, you can clone and build the GUI with the commands:

git clone https://github.com/monero-project/monero-gui
cd monero-gui
./build.sh
