## An Introduction to Cryptocurrency and Privacy

Meet Leo and George. George would like to go on vacation, but he
has not saved enough and has limited access to money. Leo, who is
George’s best friend, is kind enough to lend George $2,500 to pay for
a flight, hotel room, and food.

In traditional banking, in order for Leo to send George the $2,500, Leo
would essentially ask his bank to send the money to George’s bank.
Leo would tell George that the transaction has taken place, and
George would then be able to withdraw the needed $2,500 for his
vacation. In this transaction, Leo and George have trusted their banks
to manage the money.

There was no real movement of physical bills that took place during
the transaction. Digitally speaking, the banks edited a centralized
database that now shows $2,500 being sent from Leo to George.
Therein lies the problem: to establish trust between Leo and George,
they had to depend on a third party: the banks. This problem is also
present in the multitude of transactions happening every day, as
many of those transactions cannot occur without some third party.

This poses a risk, because a bank (or a nefarious actor) can create an
infinite amount of money by editing the transaction database or
altering your own bank account - along with other illicit acts.

In order to help mitigate such risks, the traditional banking system
can utilize a new technology called the blockchain. A blockchain is a
distributed database that continuously adds to a record of all the
transactions that have occurred within a network. This database is
often referred to as a ledger, because the data contains a large list of
transactions that have taken place.

The first distributed blockchain was conceptualized in 2008 by an
anonymous person or group known as Satoshi Nakamoto and
implemented in 2009 as a core component of Bitcoin, where it serves
as the public ledger for all transactions. The invention of the
blockchain made Bitcoin the first digital currency to solve the double
spending problem without the need for a trusted authority or central
server.

Within a distributed network, if you have many disparate parties with
no central authority, how do you ensure they all agree? The
blockchain is a way of maintaining consensus in a decentralised
distributed network. Transactions are grouped into “blocks”, which
are linked and secured using cryptography, and every time a new
block is solved (i.e. checked, signed, and verified by network
participants), these transactions are recorded on the blockchain in
chronological order. What goes into a block is just data, but it can be
anything. The most obvious example is financial transactions.

Consensus within the network is maintained because every time a
new block is solved (usually every 10 minutes or so), all participants in
the network must agree on the state of the blockchain. When this
consensus occurs, each network participant's copy of the blockchain
syncs so they all match. That way all copies march in lockstep, even
though there is no one central master copy. As a result, the
blockchain is completely unalterable as a historical record. If you take
your copy of the blockchain and go back and change something in an
earlier block, your copy of the blockchain will simply be rejected in 10
minutes at the next re-sync because your copy would not match the
rest. This provides security to the network and removes the need for
a centralized trusted third party.

Despite the potential of blockchain technology, privacy remains an
issue. The Blockchain implementation for Bitcoin could help everyone
that wants to see your transactions and amounts associated or linked
to the Bitcoin address.
If someone learns of information that links your identity to your
Bitcoin address, they can learn a ton about you. It’s possible to infer
your spending patterns (where you spend, how much, how often),
your wealth, income and whom you associate with.
Several companies exist whose entire purpose it is to track the
transfer of funds between addresses on transparent blockchains.
Below is a web provided by one of these companies, Elliptic.

Take a moment to think about your own privacy: you might notice
that governments and large technology, data, and financial
companies have access to a large amount of information about you.
Odds are that due to centralization of your private and personal
information, and lack of security, your information has been
compromised, and it is likely that information about you (such as
your address and phone number) is in the public domain without
your knowledge.
Consider the Equifax, Target, Home Depot, and Uber data breaches,
which are examples of where your personal and financial information
have been compromised: from credits cards to personal home
address, everything could be tracked.

But that's not the only problem you may find. Big tech companies
collect your data in order to provide you targed ads that could attract
you and could manipulate your vote, your thoughts or anything else.
But what would happen if the privacy couldn't be guaranteed in an
economic system?
By knowing your funds, actions, and transactions, someone could
make a profit off of you.
The solution for these problems is Monero cryptocurrency.

 
## What is Monero?

Monero is a cryptocurrency with a focus on private and censorship-resistant transactions. Most existing cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin and Ethereum, have transparent blockchains, meaning that transactions are openly-verifiable and traceable by anyone in the world. Furthermore, sending and receiving addresses for these transactions may potentially be linkable to a person's identity.

 Monero is based on the CryptoNote protocol and uses cryptographic techniques to hide information about the sender, the receiver, and the amounts transacted. Monero is not a corporation; rather it is an open source project. The project is actively developed by cryptography and distributed systems experts from all over the world. 
Many of these experts donate their free time to The Monero Project, while others are exclusively funded by the Monero community and spend more dedicated time on the project. Given that the activities of The Monero Project are decentralized, there is no one individual who is larger than the project, and it cannot be shut down by any one country, nor is it constrained by any particular legal jurisdiction. Unlike other privacy-focused projects, privacy is not an option. Monero is private by default.

## History of Monero
The underlying CryptoNote protocol that Monero is based on was originally launched by pseudonymous author Nicolas van Saberhagen in October 2013. Although, to look at the history of Monero, we have to briefly start with a cryptocurrency named Bytecoin. Like Bitcoin, the creator of Bytecoin is anonymous. It is believed that Bytecoin was created around the time a Bitcointalk thread was established to introduce the cryptocurrency in 2014.


Soon after its introduction, members of the blockchain and cryptocurrency space began viewing Bytecoin as a project and cryptocurrency that lacked credibility, due to having been premined. A member of Bitcointalk, "thankful_for_today", did some calculations about emission and noted that Bytecoin had emitted approximately 82 percent of its coins. With a premine of this size, potential centralization of the coins in circulation becomes a risk.

In light of this, "thankful_for_today" decided to fork Bytecoin in order to launch a cryptocurrency with a strong, community-driven development team working off of the CryptoNote protocol. On April 18th, 2014, "thankful_for_today" launched BitMonero and on April 30th, 2014, the cryptocurrency’s name was changed to Monero.  The word 'Monero' comes from the Esperanto language: 'mono' meaning 'money' and 'ero' meaning 'bit', which when taken together mean 'coin'. 


Since inception, many features have been added to the Monero Project that are privacy-focused.  Of note, during January 2017, the privacy of transactions was strengthened further with the optional use of the Ring Confidential Transactions (RingCT) algorithm, which introduced an additional layer of confidentiality by not displaying the amounts implicated in a transaction to someone who did not directly take part in it. By early February 2017, over 95% of all non-coinbase transactions used the optional RingCT feature. As of today, RingCT is a default feature and is no longer optional.


## Why Monero?

Monero is a leading cryptocurrency that offers:
 
* privacy: The power of the blockchain usually increases security at the cost of privacy, but with Monero's sophisticated privacy-centric technology, you get all of the security benefits of the blockchain without any of the privacy trade-offs. In Chapter V , you will be introduced to the technologies Monero utilizes to protect your privacy;

* security: Due to the power of distributed consensus, Monero cannot be hacked to steal your funds. This means that you are responsible for your money, and you do not have to trust any entity to keep it safe for you;

* decentralization: Monero cannot be centralized, that means no one can block you from sending and receiving coins.

* fungibility: Because of the on-by-default nature of the privacy technologies, Monero is fungible, meaning one Monero will always be equal to another. This means you will not need to worry about Monero being blacklisted by exchanges or vendors;

Example real uses for monero:

## Why open source?

Satoshi Nakimoto created the blockchain with a goal to have people place trust in each other rather than in centralized third parties.  Open-source software supports this goal, as anyone can review the code to make sure that it is secure.  For example, the Linux kernel is open-source and has over 5,062 contributors, and it is widely considered to be a highly secure operating system.

The benefits of open-source software, namely trust and security, align well with the goals of cryptocurrency, which is why the code to The Monero Project is completely open-source. 
The Monero Project primarily uses Git for version control (more information for developers in the 4th chapter), which also makes it easier for people to view every single proposed line of code to be added, removed or modified.
An important concept to understand is that a lack of transparency in the development team leads to less trust in the community.  With Monero, the developer meetings are open on IRC for all to view, with logs posted on the project website. Due to this open nature, no information can be leaked because everything is already open and available, and with over 240 developers contributing to, reviewing, and testing the code, there is a lower likelihood that an error is missed. If you have doubts, there are many tools available to check out the different aspects of Monero.
