## An Introduction to Cryptocurrency and Privacy

In order to understand the value of cryptocurrency and how it is different than traditional banking, it helps to understand the way we transfer money between ourselves. Let's looks an example with our friends Leo and George. George would like to go on vacation, but he has not saved enough. Leo, who is George’s best friend, is kind enough to lend George $2,500 to pay for a flight, hotel room, and food.

Let imagine that Leo has $2500 in his wallet in cash; Leo would be able to reach into his wallet and pull out the bills and hand them to his friend George. He could be said to be doing so *trustlessly*, because he doesn't have to trust anyone else to handle the money it is being physically handed from him to his friend and nobody can stop him from doing so.

But unfortunately, despite being best friends, Leo and George live on opposite sides of the country. So, even if he had cash, Leo wouldn't be able to trustlessly give the cash to his friend George because he's too far away. It's possible he could mail cash through the postal system, but then he would have to *trust* that the postal system would not lose the money, or that someone in the post office, or even a mail carrier would not steal the money.

Well, what if Leo and George had the same bank? Leo could instruct his bank to give the money to George via a transfer. Then, the bank would deduct the money from his account and then could add the money to George's account. In this case though, Leo has to deposit the cash he has in the bank and *trust* the bank to hold the money. 

It's important to remember, that when you deposit money in the bank, you don't really just have money sitting in an account with your name on it. Instead, what you really have done is *lent* money to the bank. They *owe* it to you. This is what is called a *liability*. They are allowed to use your funds for other things that the bank would like to do (like making money via lending or for investments). They are required to give it back when you ask, but the money really just exists as an IOU on some database inside of their bank. So, because Leo and George have the same bank, the bank can simply change Leo's IOU to say that they owe him $2500 less, and George's IOU that they owe him $2500 more. (They debit Leo's account and subsequently credit George's account.) 

Both Leo and George have to trust the bank will be honest and will give them their money when they ask and will not go out of business or bankrupt while holding onto their money. Many countries have deposit insurance institutions that may be government run, or a part of the central bank, or even private institutions (one example would be the FDIC in the US). Deposit insurance allows banks to lend out or invest some of the money that they hold and not have to keep the full balance on hand, because if something bad happens where they lose the money, or they go bankrupt, the deposit insurance will make sure that everyone still gets their money back from the bank; this is called *fractional-reserve banking* and it is what is used over most of the world. So, Leo and George can trust their bank as long as they trust the government or institution that insures the money in the bank. In some places, under corrupt, or inefficient governments, this could be a bad idea, but non-the-less they have no choice if they wish to move money across large distances in the traditional banking system they currently have.

So, what if Leo and George *don't* have the same bank? How do they transfer money? Let's say that Leo banks with Chase Bank, and George Banks with USAA. From Leo's perspective, Leo would need to do the same thing; Leo would ask Chase Bank to reduce the balance in his account and transfer money to George's bank account at USAA where they would increase the balance by the same amount and be updated on the *other* bank's central database. But how does this happen? Why would USAA agree to owe George more? How does this work if the banks don't *trust* each other? Certainly it's possible that after they credit George's account at USAA, the other bank might go out of business and not be able to pay them the $2500 that they allowed George to have. They would be increasing their liability to George, but they would want to decrease their liability to someone else, so that it balances out. The answer would then be for Chase Bank to have an account with USAA, that way when they change the IOU in their central database at USAA, they are reducing the balance that they owe to Chase Bank and they're increasing the amount that they owe George. This arrangement is what is called correspondent banking and it allows the banks to facilitate payments between their respective customers.

So, what's the problem with this system? What if the banks didn't have a relationship with each other? How would they facilitate the transfer of funds? They might need to route thru another correspondent bank that has a relationship with USAA, or even many other banks. This adds cost and complexity. They would be opening themselves up to a lot of risk if they didn't have the funds on hand from the other bank, so they can't just trust that they will get the money from the other bank eventually. Another problem with this, is that if the banks have to hold funds in other banks in order to facilitate transfers to every other bank, it means that they have less funds available to lend and invest, which is one of the primary ways that they make money. Having funds on hand that they can use and invest is called *liquidity*. 

Well, what about something like SWIFT? Can't the banks just send funds directly? SWIFT (Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication) is a cooperative owned by its members. Member banks are categorized based on their ownership of shares and member banks pay a joining fee, and annual fee based on their categorization. SWIFT provides and network that financial institutions can use to send and receive secure messages in a reliable and standard way. It's important to remember though that SWIFT is a messaging system and does not itself facilitate any transfer of money. SWIFT does not settle or clear any funds, instead it sends payment orders that must be settled by correspondent accounts that banks have with each other. It's simply a standardized way for banks to talk about the money that must be transferred. Banks still need to rely on the same correspondent banking previously mentioned. Not only that, but SWIFT charges users for messages based on the length and type of message. These charges may be different depending on the volume of messages that are sent by that bank. So, transferring money costs the bank money.

Banks are concerned with cost and liquidity, they don't want to spend a lot of money to move money back and forth between banks and they don't want to keep all of their money tied up at correspondent banks where they can't use it to lend or invest and make more money. 

So, one thing that we should consider, is that it is just as likely for Leo to want to send money to George as it is for George to want to send to Leo; Being that they're good friends, George hopefully will pay back the $2500 that his friend lent him. There are many thousands of transactions that go between customers at USAA and Chase Bank on a daily basis, so instead of settling each transaction individually, what if the banks just kept track of the balance and settled between themselves at the end of the day? This is called deferred net settlement. There are equivalents for this all over the world, in the UK, they use something called BACS and in the US they use ACH. In deferred net settlement, messages aren't sent between banks directly, but instead are sent to some central clearing system, that on some schedule calculates the net amount that owed by one bank to another that are then settled in another way; perhaps with correspondent accounts that they hold with each other or via other system we'll be discussing next. This allows banks to retain liquidity and cuts down on cost. Instead of Chase sending USAA hundreds of thousands of dollars or keeping hundreds of thousands of dollars in an account at USAA, and USAA doing the same thing but opposite, they can settle between themselves for only the difference of all the transfers.

The problem with this system is that transactions lose settlement finality. Finality means that the transaction is finished and the funds are transferred and the bank can release those funds to George so he can purchase his vacation, but George's bank has to wait to receive the net settlement, before it can make the funds available. It would be risky for them to allow George to have the money if they haven't yet received it from the other bank, because it's possible that the other bank could go bust or not send them the money or reverse the transaction. Transactions of this sort add a delay, so George won't be able to use the money his friend Leo has sent him very soon at all.

This system works relatively well for small amounts, but isn't the safest for banks for large amounts. So what else could banks do if they need to be absolutely sure that a transfer will be made quickly, cannot be reversed, even if the other bank goes out of business before the money is transferred? Would it be possible for banks to hold an account with one bank that couldn't possibly go out of business and that could facilitate the transfers between each bank? Yes, and this is what is used around the world in many shapes and forms; this is what is called a central bank. Banks can move money between each other by instructing the central bank to debit one account and credit the other banks account that they each hold at the central bank. Examples of such systems are the Fedwire in the US, or CHAPS in the UK. Fedwire facilitates transfers that are instant, gross (no netting because then it wouldn't be instant), and with finality (there can be no reversals); this is a type of system that can be referred to as a real-time gross settlement system and it is a way for banks that move large amounts of money to each other to move money without trusting each other, but instead by trusting the central bank (which in most cases is run by a government). 

Leo and George's transaction probably wouldn't be done via Fedwire because it has large cost. It might be done via SWIFT or ACH or check or some other deferred settlement system, but I imagine if they *could* transfer instantly and immediately they would prefer to do so without involving a third party.

So the real problem is that given the distance at which they are transacting, there are layers upon layers of trust that Leo must have in the system that he is using just to give his friend George enough money to take a nice vacation. Leo must trust that the bank won't abscond with his money that he has given them to hold, George's bank must trust that Leo's bank will give them the money if they allow Leo to have it and won't reverse the transaction, or the banks have to trust the central bank to transfer the money between their accounts.

In a modern functioning country and economy, some of these things are pretty ridiculous to imagine, but in the global picture, there aren't always the kinds of protections (like deposit insurance), or systems in place free from corruption. There are banks, and businesses, and people who can't rely on their government and shady business practices, and banks that go out of business. There's no guarantee that the systems that remain in place will continue to do so and operate in a manner that is fair for all participants. There is an incredible amount of complexity in our financial system with lots of room for problems to arise. These layers of trust and steps of verification add cost, and delay to Leo and George's transaction.

What does this have to do with cryptocurrency? What if Leo could send money to George directly, in a trustless way, in a way that could not be reversed, with minimal delay, that doesn't require the involvement of a bank, or even banks, or government? How about Chase and USAA; how can they transact and settle their accounts without having to trust each other and without having to pay a third party like the SWIFT network or the central bank for the privilege of doing business with each other while retaining as much liquidity as possible and reducing costs, for their profit and to the benefit of their customers and shareholders?

To do that, banks and individuals can use something called blockchain. Blockchain is a technology that is a distributed database that continuously adds to a record of all the transactions that have occurred within a network. This database is often referred to as a ledger, because the data contains a large list of transactions that have taken place.

The first distributed blockchain was conceptualized in 2008 by an anonymous person or group known as Satoshi Nakamoto and implemented in 2009 as a core component of Bitcoin, where it serves as the public ledger for all transactions on the Bitcoin network. The invention of the blockchain made Bitcoin the first digital currency to solve the double spending problem without the need for a trusted authority or central server. 

Within a distributed network, if you have many disparate parties with no central authority, how do you ensure they all agree? The blockchain is a way of maintaining consensus in a decentralized distributed network. Transactions are grouped into “blocks”, which are linked and secured using cryptography, and every time a new block is solved (i.e. checked, signed, and verified by network participants), these transactions are recorded on the blockchain in chronological order. What goes into a block is just data, but it can be anything. The most obvious example is financial transactions.

Consensus within the network is maintained because every time a new block is solved (usually every 10 minutes or so), all participants in the network must agree on the state of the blockchain; When this consensus occurs, each network participant's copy of the blockchain syncs so they all match. That way all copies march in lockstep, even though there is no one central master copy. As a result, the blockchain is completely unalterable as a historical record. If you take your copy of the blockchain and go back and change something in an earlier block, your copy of the blockchain will simply be rejected in 10 minutes at the next re-sync because your copy would not match the rest. This provides security to the network and removes the need for a centralized trusted third party. So, cryptocurrency can conceivably work as the central bank in the real-time gross settlement system we had discussed before, without needing to trust that central bank, or your bank, or any third party.

Despite the potential of blockchain technology, privacy remains an issue; Bitcoin allows anyone that wants to see your transactions and amounts associated or linked to the Bitcoin address, because the nature of the blockchain that it uses. Because Bitcoin uses a public ledger that is verified by all participants, all transactions are public. If someone learns of information that links your identity to your Bitcoin address, they can learn a ton about you. It’s possible to infer your spending patterns (where you spend, how much, how often), your wealth, income and whom you associate with. Just the simple act of transacting with someone allows them to look at the blockchain to see how much money you have in your Bitcoin wallet, because the address that it funds are transferred from is public on the blockchain. This means that if you use Bitcoin to buy something online, the owner of the website could know how much money you have in your Bitcoin wallet. Several companies exist whose entire purpose it is to track the transfer of funds between addresses on transparent blockchains. One of these companies, Elliptic (www.elliptic.co), purport on their site to "provide actionable intelligence to financial institutions and law enforcement agencies." and it is entirely possible that in the future that people who hold large amounts of cryptocurrency could be targeted by criminals. 

Take a moment to think about your own privacy: you might notice that governments and large technology, data, and financial companies have access to a large amount of information about you. Odds are that due to centralization of your private and personal information, and lack of security, your information has been compromised, and it is likely that information about you (such as your address and phone number) is in the public domain without your knowledge. Consider the Equifax, Target, Home Depot, and Uber data breaches, which are examples of where your personal and financial information have been compromised: from credits cards to personal home address, everything could be tracked and then leaked.

But that's not the only problem you may find. Big tech companies collect your data in order to provide you targeted ads that could attract you and could manipulate your vote, your thoughts or anything else. For example, note the Cambridge Analytics and Facebook case and imagine how many information about their users they could sell.

But what would happen if the privacy couldn't be guaranteed in an economic system?

By knowing your how much money you have, where you shop, and who you transact with, someone could manipulate you or make money off your information, or target you. The solution for many of these problems is the Monero cryptocurrency.

  ## What is Monero?

Monero is a leading cryptocurrency with a focus on private and censorship-resistant transactions. Most existing cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin and Ethereum, have transparent blockchains, meaning that transactions are openly verifiable and traceable by anyone in the world. Furthermore, sending and receiving addresses for these transactions may potentially be linkable to a person’s identity.

Monero is based on the CryptoNote protocol and it uses advanced cryptographic techniques in order to hide the sender, the receiver, and the amounts transacted. Monero is not a corporation or organization; it is an actually an open source software project.

The project is actively developed by cryptography and distributed systems experts from all over the world. Many of these experts donate their free time to The Monero Project, while others are exclusively funded by the Monero community and spend more dedicated time on the project.

Given that the activities of The Monero Project are decentralized, there is no individual who is larger than the project and it cannot be shut down by any one country and is not constrained by any particular legal jurisdiction.

Unlike other privacy-focused projects like Zcash, privacy is not an option. Monero is private by default.

## History of Monero

The underlying CryptoNote protocol that Monero is based on was originally described by pseudonymous author Nicolas van Saberhagen in October 2013. [infographic: Roadmap and History]

To look at the history of Monero, we have to briefly start with a cryptocurrency named Bytecoin based on the CryptoNote protocol. Like Bitcoin, the creator of Bytecoin is anonymous. It is believed that Bytecoin was created around the time a Bitcointalk thread was established to introduce the cryptocurrency in 2014.

Soon after its introduction, members of the blockchain and cryptocurrency space began viewing Bytecoin as a project and cryptocurrency that lacked credibility, due to having been pre-mined. A member of Bitcointalk, “thankful_for_today”, did some calculations about emission and noted that Bytecoin had emitted approximately 82 percent of its coins. With a pre-mine of this size, potential centralization of the coins in circulation becomes a risk.

In light of this, “thankful_for_today” decided to fork Bytecoin in order to launch a cryptocurrency with a strong, community-driven development team working off of the CryptoNote protocol. On April 18th, 2014, “thankful_for_today” launched BitMonero and on April 30th, 2014, the name of the cryptocurrency was changed to Monero.

During January 2017, the privacy of transactions was strengthened further with the optional use of the Ring Confidential Transactions (RingCT) algorithm, which introduced an additional layer of confidentiality by not displaying the amounts implicated in a transaction to someone who did not directly take part in it. By early February 2017, over 95% of all non-coinbase transactions used the optional RingCT feature. As of today, RingCT is a default feature and is no longer optional.

 ## Why Monero?

Monero is a leading cryptocurrency that offers: 

* Privacy: The power of the blockchain usually increases security at the cost of privacy, but with Monero’s sophisticated privacy-centric technology, you get all of the security benefits of the blockchain without any of the privacy trade-offs. In the 6th Chapter, you will be introduced to the technologies Monero utilizes to protect your privacy;

* Security: Monero cannot be hacked to steal your funds, due to the power of distributed consensus. This means that you are responsible for your money, and you do not have to trust any entity to keep it safe for you;

* Decentralisation: Monero cannot be centralized, meaning no one can block you from sending and receiving coins;

* Fungibility: Because of the on-by-default nature of the privacy technologies, Monero is fungible, meaning one Monero will always be equal to another. This means you will not need to worry about Monero being blacklisted by exchanges or vendors.

## Monero Goal

The Monero Mission is providing privacy by default. No strange setup, no settings, Monero provides you unique techniques by default for protecting you and your funds. The Monero Community and The Monero Core Team want to create a powerful and helpful system in order to help you in protecting your privacy by reading this book and resources (official websites, books).

## Why open source?

Satoshi Nakimoto created the blockchain with a goal to have people place trust in each other rather than in centralized third parties. Open-source software supports this goal, as anyone can review the code to make sure that it is secure. For example, the Linux kernel is open-source and has over 5,062 contributors, and it is widely considered to be a highly secure operating system.

The benefits of open-source software, namely trust and security, align well with the goals of cryptocurrency, which is why the code to The Monero Project is completely open-source.

The Monero Project primarily uses Git for version control (more information for developers in the 5th chapter), which also makes it easier for people to view every single proposed line of code to be added, removed or modified.

An important concept to understand is that a lack of transparency in the development team leads to less trust in the community. With Monero, the developer meetings are open on IRC for all to view, with logs posted on the project website.

Due to this open nature, no information can be leaked because everything is already open and available, and with over 240 developers contributing to, reviewing, and testing the code, there is a lower likelihood that an error is missed. If you have doubts, there are many tools available to check out the different aspects of Monero.


## Ethical discussion

Everyone knows about Monero and its uses for Dark Markets on the "hidden" web called deep web. Monero wasn't created for this goal, we believe in our community and we hope nobody will use Monero for these illegal purposes. 
If you are reading this book to know about Monero with the goal of using it on dark and illegal markets, please close this ebook and enjoy your life.

## Real Examples for Monero

**Example 1** – As a business, when you make a payment to one of your suppliers for the goods they have provided to you, they can now access all your bitcoin transaction history and see which other suppliers you are dealing with.
Knowing this information, they might raise the price of their goods and take away your power to negotiate since your public ledger is already available to them.

**Example 2** – You visit a country or part of a country that has high crime rate. You make several purchases while visiting different places there—maybe to collect souvenirs on your way back home. 
Now, every shop or individual you have done a transaction with knows the frequency of your transactions, their sizes and the current bitcoin balance you have. This puts you in a dangerous situation.

**Example 3** – You are a service provider where you charge your clients on a per-project basis. Being a reputable entity in the industry you not only charge clients for your services, but also for the value you bring to the table. 
However, looking at your past records in the public ledger your customers might never pay you the value of your service and end up negotiating your service fees most of the times.
