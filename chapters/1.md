## An Introduction to Cryptocurrency and Privacy

Meet Leo and George. George would like to go on vacation, but he has not saved enough and has limited access to money. Leo, who is George's best friend, is kind enough to lend George $2,500 to pay for a flight, hotel room, and food.

In traditional banking, in order for Leo to send George the $2,500, Leo would ask his bank to send the money to George's bank. Leo would tell George that the transaction has taken place, and George would then be able to withdraw the needed $2,500 for his vacation. In this transaction, Leo and George have trusted their banks to manage the money.

There was no real movement of physical bills that took place during the transaction. Digitally speaking, the banks edited a centralized database that now shows $2,500 being sent from Leo to George. Therein lies the problem: to establish trust between Leo and George, they had to depend on a third party: the banks. If the banks rely on other institutions like credit rating agencies and market conditions in order not to run out of business, George and Leo have to rely on them too. For people living under corrupt, authoritarian regimes, even trusting the justice system to protect you from basic fraud can be a very real problem. This same required web of trust is present the multitude of transactions happening every day, as many of those transactions cannot occur without some third party.

But how else would modern financial transactions get done? After all, digital files have no real value. If someone attempted to send someone a string of bytes as currency, there'd be no way to prevent someone copying them until they lost their value. Until there is some fiat currency that we can give to sellers on craigslist, we must trust third party payment systems like PayPal to assure us our money has been transfered. What we need is new form of currency, one that has value in of itself (i.e. the units of which cannot be endlessly reprinted), and can be transported over long distances at low cost without the need to put faith in large banks. In order for such a currency to exist, we would need a public, transparent document tracking all money transfers so that every party could verify the authenticity of their digital money. That way no one could spend any given token twice, and we could finally have a scarce digital resource to trade without relying on a third party to validate the transaction.

Enter the blockchain. A blockchain is a distributed database that continuously adds to a record of all the transactions that have occurred within a network. This database is often referred to as a ledger, because the data contains a large list of transactions that have taken place.

The first distributed blockchain was conceptualized in 2008 by an anonymous person or group known as Satoshi Nakamoto and implemented in 2009 as a core component of Bitcoin, where it serves as the public ledger for all transactions. The invention of the blockchain made Bitcoin the first digital currency to solve the double spending problem without the need for a trusted authority or central server.

Within this distributed network, if there are many disparate parties transfering funds with no central authority, how do you ensure they all agree on who owns what Bitcoin? The blockchain is a way of maintaining consensus in a decentralised distributed network. Transactions are grouped into ?blocks?, which are linked and secured using cryptography, and every time a new block is solved (i.e. checked, signed, and verified by network participants), these transactions are recorded on the blockchain in chronological order. What goes into a block is just data, but that data can represent anything. The most obvious example is financial transactions.

Consensus within the network is maintained because every time a new block is solved (usually every 10 minutes or so), all participants in the network must agree on the state of the blockchain; When this consensus occurs, each network participant's copy of the blockchain syncs so they all match. That way all copies march in lockstep, even though there is no one central master copy. As a result, the blockchain is completely unalterable as a historical record. If you take your copy of the blockchain and change in an earlier block, your copy of the blockchain will simply be rejected in 10 minutes at the next re-sync because your copy would not match the rest. We have finally a digital store of value that can be paid without relying on the competence and well-meaning of third parties.

Despite the potential of blockchain technology, privacy remains an issue. The Blockchain implementation for Bitcoin means that everyone can see all the transactions associated with any address made on the network. If someone can link your identity to your Bitcoin address, they can learn a ton about you. It?s possible to infer your spending patterns (where you spend, how much, how often), your wealth, income and whom you associate with by looking at your payment history. There are several companies that make a living by tracking the transfer of funds between addresses on transparent blockchains. Below is a web provided by one of these companies, Elliptic.

Take a moment to think about your own privacy: you might notice that governments and large technology, data, and financial companies have access to a large amount of information about you. Odds are that due to centralization of your private and personal information, and lack of security, your information has been compromised, and it is likely that information about you (such as your address and phone number) is in the public domain without your knowledge. Consider the Equifax, Target, Home Depot, and Uber data breaches, and you'll being to realize that from credits cards to personal home addresses, almost everything someone would need to target you is gathered and then leaked by some organization at some point throughout your life.

But that's not the only problem you may find. Big tech companies don't just collect your data so they can provide better services, they do it to affect the way you interact with them. Analytics companies are constantly analyzing and probing your information in order to provide you targeted ads that compel you to buy their products and manipulate your vote, your public opinion or anything else. The truth about Cambridge Analytics is that they are not a new problem; they are just one actor in the war for your mind. The research they do is nothing more than an extension of the work done by other propogandists, all trying to pioneer the best psychoanalysis of you and everyone else with a pocketbook or an opinion.

There often feels like there is little hope in a post-internet era for the recapture of our privacy. It's easy to give in to the notion that the world has changed and data capitalism is as unrelenting a force as the steam engine. But the truth is that there is nothing "inevitable" about the modern surveillance economy, and there is nothing unopposable about Facebook or Google or any of the other media giants. All of these systems that watch and bind us could be overthrown in a flash for distributed, user controlled, privacy respecting alternatives so long as the people had the will to replace them. We can start with Monero.

  ## What is Monero?

Monero is a leading cryptocurrency built to solve Bitcoin's problems with making private and censorship-resistant transactions. Monero is based on the CryptoNote protocol and it uses the gifts of modern cryptography to hide the sender, the receiver, and the amounts transacted. Monero is not a corporation, nor is it under the direction of any government; it is an open source project, created by its users for nothing but the civil liberties they lost in new era.

The project is actively developed by cryptography and distributed systems experts from all over the world. Many of these experts donate their free time to The Monero Project, while others are exclusively funded by the Monero community and are grateful for the opportunity to dedicate their career.

Like the currency itself, the activities of The Monero Project are decentralized. There is no individual who is larger than the project, it cannot be shut down by any the decree of any one country, and is not constrained by any particular legal jurisdiction.

Unlike other privacy-focused projects like Zcash, privacy is not an option. Monero is private by default.

## History of Monero

The underlying CryptoNote protocol that Monero is based on was originally described by pseudonymous author Nicolas van Saberhagen in October 2013. [infographic: Roadmap and History]

To understand the history of Monero, we have to briefly start with a cryptocurrency named Bytecoin based on the CryptoNote protocol. Like Bitcoin, the creator of Bytecoin is anonymous. It is believed that Bytecoin was created around the time a Bitcointalk thread was established to introduce the cryptocurrency in 2014.

Soon after its introduction, members of the blockchain and cryptocurrency space began worrying about Bytecoin's credibility, due to having been pre-mined. Premining is a term for when developer of a cryptocurrency preliminarily mines coins before introducing it to the public. A new cryptocurrency project having a large premine a warning sign it might be a pump-and-dump scam, and that the developer is simply looking to cash out and run when the price increases.

A member of Bitcointalk, ?thankful_for_today?, did some calculations about emission and noted that Bytecoin had emitted approximately 82 percent of its coins. With a pre-mine of this size, potential centralization of the coins in circulation becomes a risk.

In light of this, ?thankful_for_today? decided to fork Bytecoin in order to launch a cryptocurrency with a strong, community-driven development team working off of the CryptoNote protocol. On April 18th, 2014, ?thankful_for_today? launched BitMonero and on April 30th, 2014, the name of the cryptocurrency was changed to Monero.

During January 2017, the privacy of transactions was strengthened further with the optional use of the Ring Confidential Transactions (RingCT) algorithm, which introduced an additional layer of confidentiality by not displaying the amounts implicated in a transaction to someone who did not directly take part in it. By early February 2017, over 95% of all non-coinbase transactions used the optional RingCT feature. As of today, RingCT is a default feature and is no longer optional.

 ## Why Monero?

Monero is a leading cryptocurrency that offers: 

* Privacy: The power of the blockchain usually increases security at the cost of privacy, but with Monero?s sophisticated privacy-centric technology, you get all of the security benefits of the blockchain without any of the privacy trade-offs. In the 6th Chapter, you will be introduced to the technologies Monero utilizes to protect your privacy;

* Security: Monero cannot be hacked to steal your funds, due to the power of distributed consensus. This means that you are responsible for your money, and you do not have to trust any entity to keep it safe for you;

* Decentralisation: Monero cannot be centralized, meaning no one can block you from sending and receiving coins;

* Fungibility: Because of the on-by-default nature of the privacy technologies, Monero is fungible, meaning one Monero will always be equal to another. This means you will not need to worry about your Monero being blacklisted by exchanges or vendors because of which hands they've touched.

## Monero Goal

The Monero Mission is providing privacy by default. No strange setup, no settings, Monero provides you these unique techniques without requiring you to be a graduate student in computer science or understand the mathematical foundation of public key cryptography. The Monero Community and The Monero Core Team want to create a powerful and helpful currency designed to be easy to use and supplemented with resources like the book you're reading.

## Why open source?

Satoshi Nakimoto created the blockchain to enable people to trust in each other rather than in centralized third parties. Open-source software complements this goal, as anyone can review the code to make sure that it is secure. Most software people are accustomed to is closed source, meaning that the original code used to create the program is copyrighted and protected like a trade secret. With closed source software, there is no way for outside parties to verify that an application isn't spying on their users, and indeed, since Edward Snowden's revelations in 2013, many pieces of closed-source software have been found to do just that. By making the code widely available, users can verify they are downloading software with no pre-installed backdoors for the NSA or any other entity to walk in.

The benefits of open-source software, namely trust and security, align well with the goals of cryptocurrency, which is why the code to The Monero Project is completely open-source.

But Monero goes beyond just making the source code of its currency available, and endeavours to implement trust and openness in its entire decision making process. A lack of transparency in the development team leads to less trust in the community. With Monero, the developer meetings are open on IRC for all to view, with logs posted on the project website.

There is no information that can be leaked about Monero because everything, from the final products code to the arguments between contributors, is already open and available. And, with over 240 developers contributing to, reviewing, and testing the code, there is a lower likelihood that an error is missed. If you have doubts, why not start by taking a stroll through the community yourself?


## Ethics

It's been widely publicized that Monero has favor with criminals as a means of facilitating illegal transactions because of its designed privacy protections. 
Monero wasn't created for this goal, and the fact that its commitment to privacy is useful to criminals not a reason to deny its use to rights-conscious-citizens.
If you are reading this book to know about Monero with the goal of using it on dark and illegal markets, we suggest you close it and get on with your life. Monero is not
a magic shield that prevents you from getting caught by the government and by associating the currency with criminal behaviour you are curtailing its adoption and development.

## Real Examples for Monero

**Example 1** ? As a business, when you make a payment to one of your suppliers for the goods they have provided to you, they can now access all your bitcoin transaction history and see which other suppliers you are dealing with.
Knowing this information, they might raise the price of their goods and take away your power to negotiate since your public ledger is already available to them.

**Example 2** ? You visit a country or part of a country that has high crime rate. You make several purchases while visiting different places there?maybe to collect souvenirs on your way back home. 
Now, every shop or individual you have done a transaction with knows the frequency of your transactions, their sizes and the current bitcoin balance you have. This puts you in a dangerous situation.

**Example 3** ? You are a service provider where you charge your clients on a per-project basis. Being a reputable entity in the industry you not only charge clients for your services, but also for the value you bring to the table. 
However, looking at your past records in the public ledger your customers might never pay you the value of your service and end up negotiating your service fees most of the times.
