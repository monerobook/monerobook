## Writing the Mastering Monero Book 
I am Nico (“SerHack”), an Italian security researcher, a Monero contributor, and the publisher of this book. Finding good resources and learning about cryptocurrencies can be a daunting task. For new users, it can be especially challenging to track down documentation written at an understandable technical level. When I first started learning about Monero, I had to spend a great deal of time seeking out and evaluating many different resources on the topic. 

The community decided to write Mastering Monero to guide you along this journey, whether you’re setting up your first wallet or curious about the ‘under the hood’ technical details. The first few chapters are written for anybody curious about why and how to use Monero; they contain easy-to-understand explanations and examples, alongside instructions for practical use. Later chapters progress into more advanced topics, compiling information for developers who wish to build and contribute to the Monero project.

My adventure into the world of cryptocurrencies began when I learned about Bitcoin in January 2016.

From the beginning, I have been concerned about the ramifications of its transparent public ledger. Since Bitcoin and most other cryptocurrencies are built around openly-linked addresses and coins with clear histories, transactions often inadvertently expose users’ personal financial details. Every address balance is public information, which allows anybody to research your income, spending habits, and amount of cryptocurrency wealth. This can lead to undesirable consequences, such as price manipulation based on wallet balance.

I thought that Bitcoin was the only cryptocurrency until a friend introduced me to Monero in May 2017. I was blown away by its beautiful new paradigm: a world where vulnerable details such as account balances and transaction amounts are kept confidential to protect both the sender and the receiver. With privacy features implemented by default and always required, the entire Monero blockchain is veiled and users do not even have the option to accidentally send revealing transactions.

Recognizing the importance of this project, I began looking for ways to contribute to the community. I quickly saw an opportunity to support mass adoption by building payment gateways for online businesses, so I spearheaded the Monero Integrations project. This open-source codebase is designed around Monero’s privacy-centric mentality: no signup or third-party service is required since funds are routed directly to the recipient’s wallet. The Monero community was very supportive throughout this endeavor, and the entire enterprise was crowdfunded by donations through the Monero Forum Funding System (FFS). 

While working on the Monero Integrations project, I learned that the lack of a comprehensive guide to Monero was an obstacle both for end users and prospective contributors. This need for a thorough guide inspired me to write Mastering Monero as a universal resource for our global community. I am grateful for the generous FFS support that has made it possible to publish this document as a free eBook (and physical book!) for the general public. Whether you read Mastering Monero cover-to-cover or jump through sections pertinent to your questions, I hope you enjoy learning about Monero and the exciting projects within the community.


## How this resource is organized

This book is organized roughly in line with the dependencies between the different topics covered.

The first chapter will show how the blockchain resolves several problems with our mainstream economic system and banking system in particular. However, the blockchain is not a full solution to our cryptocurrency needs. One problem still remains: Assuring the privacy of online transactions. With Monero, we will realize what privacy is and why we care about it. This will be helpful and useful for newbies and for users that sometimes forgot the Monero principles.

The second chapter starts to explore the "practical" applications of Monero: we will understand the different types of existing wallets, learn how to create one with Monero GUI, and finally find out how to get our first Monero.

We will explore how Monero actually works in the third chapter. Here we will discover how the Monero Team developed a cryptocurrency that hides transactions from third parties by default. 

The fourth chapter is for any users that want to help the community in order to translate, build or improve Monero in any way. No worries about how we can help, the important part is doing that! We will join the Monero community!

The fifth chapter overviews a "hot"-topic argument: the mining process which is confirming transactions for other users. We'll see what it's and why it's important in order to guarantee a solid and trustable system for our transactions.

After five chapters of introduction based on getting started, mining, building, and learning how Monero works we will dive into the internals Monero more deeply. This chapter includes a lot of technical details about Monero, especially Cryptography details. Stealth addresses, Ring Transactions, and Ring Confidential Transactions won't be buzzwords anymore since *you'll* be informed on how they properly work from the ground up. For developers and experts only, the sixth chapter will be the technical explanation of the CryptoNote Protocol. If you can't understand any of the explanations included in this chapter, don't say we didn't warn you: this book is called Mastering Monero for a reason.

In the seventh chapter, we will step back to look at the Monero network and a sub Monero project Kovri, an open source C++ I2P implementation. We'll know why it's important and why it's being developed. You will be an expert about Nodes and P2P protocol.

When we have finished reading the first seven chapters of the book, we'll begin to think how to incorporate Monero into our finances. If Monero is such a revolutionary cryptocurrency, how I can integrate Monero to my business? The eighth chapter will provide you all the answers to these questions. From the JSON RPC to the OpenAlias sub project, everyone can start accepting Monero.
