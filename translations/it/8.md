## Specific Instructions for Official Monero GUI

The following instructions show how to carry out the tasks described above through the Monero graphical user interface (GUI). If you are using a different wallet, you can skip this section.

### 1. Choose a language

The official Monero GUI can be downloaded from [https://getmonero.org/downloads](https://getmonero.org/downloads). Once you have unpackaged and launched the application, you will be presented with a language selection screen:

If you don’t see your language above, please feel free to [submit a translation to help others](https://github.com/monero-project/monero-gui/tree/master/translations)! Once you select a language, the GUI will ask whether you wish to generate a new seed, or restore an existing wallet.

### 2. Specify an option
  
The Monero GUI offers three options for wallet type: Mainnet, Testnet, and Stagenet. 

Choose Mainnet (default option) to access the regular blockchain with real Monero. The Testnet and Stagenet are two separate blockchains that are used by developers for developing and testing new code. The Testnet and Stagenet Monero do not have any real monetary value, and cannot be transferred to the mainnet.

If this is your first Monero wallet, press “create new wallet.” The Monero software will generate a new seed for you, and show you the 25-word seed mnemonic.

### 3. Write down the seed

Remember, the seed is not like a password! The network cannot restore access to your funds if you lose your seed.

Be sure to write this down and store it in a safe place where nobody else will find it!


### 4. Enter a password
You can enter a wallet password to keep your fund secure if somebody else accesses your computer. The wallet password is a local security feature, like a PIN screen unlock. It does not impact the cryptography or how your moneroj are stored on the blockchain, so restoring your wallet from the seed will bypass the local passphrase.

### 5. Download the Monero blockchain

Next, you will have the option to start your own node, or connect to a remote node.

Running your own node requires at least 60 GB of diskspace to store the blockchain. If your devices has limited resources, you can select “connect to a remote node” to configure a lightweight wallet that accesses data stored elsewhere. You can learn more about the pros and cons of using a remote node in section 4.2.3 “Local nodes” versus “remote nodes”.
   
## Then.. Welcome to Monero GUI!


### 8.1.2 Receiving Monero with the GUI

The “Receive” tab of the Monero GUI contains both the text and QR-code forms of your receiving addresses. The “Create new address” button generates more “subaddresses,” which will all direct to this same wallet (seed). If you are charging somebody for a particular amount, you can enter the “Amount,” which will then be encoded into the QR code.

### 8.1.3 Sending Monero with the GUI

To send Monero, you simply specify the amount that you wish to send, and the recipient's address. The Payment ID field can be left blank, unless your recipient specifies a Payment ID in advance. The Description field is stored locally, so you can leave notes for yourself. These will not be recovered if you restore your wallet from a seed.

### 8.1.4 Proof of Payment with the GUI

Proof of payment verification is available through the GUI under “prove/check.” The screenshoot above shows the transaction ID, address, and transaction key from the Maria & Kahn example in chapter 2.

## 8.2 Specific instruction for Monero Wallet CLI

The following instructions show how to carry out the tasks described above through the Monero command line interface (CLI). If you are using a different wallet, you can skip this section.

### 8.2.1 Setting up a wallet with the CLI

The official Monero CLI can be downloaded from https://getmonero.org/downloads. The command for running the CLI varies depending on your operating system. In Linux, simply launch ./monero-wallet-cli from the program folder. You can add extra flags (documented in this Chapter) if you wish to connect to a remote node, bind your IP address, or other advanced options.

    $ wget https://downloads.getmonero.org/cli/linux64

### 8.2.2 Receiving Monero
You can find out your address by typing address. If you wish to combine the address with a payment ID, you can type integrated_address to generate a random payment ID, or you can specify a particular ID as an input argument, such as:

    [wallet 433bhJ]: integrated_address 12346780abcdef00

### 8.2.3 Sending Monero 

Use the transfer command to send Monero. To send moneroj to a single address, you do not have to specify the mixin number (during the October 2018, an hard fork requires to have a fixed mixin number of 11); you have to text the recipient address, and the amount to send. To use the CLI to send the 0.6 XMR transaction describedabove, the command would be: 

    [wallet 433bhJ]:  transfer 4758W1dAkifB2G1wQKmPWRvPs9zdsb5ctRFW2ttQbkQxYHRuPRdHZ9ijqJ7oxcns9SvtpiH8ti8BRjL3LUHaBURpiz4KF​ 0.06
    
### 8.2.4 Proof of payment

By default, transaction keys are not recorded by the CLI, however you can enable this by: set store-tx-info 1. You can locate a transaction key by specifying the transaction ID as the first argument of get_tx_key, for example:

    [wallet 433bhJ]: get_tx_key 4b540773ddf9e819f0df47708f3d3c9f7f62933150b90edc8910 3d36d42ca4b7

To verify a transaction key, the syntax is: check_tx_key TXID TXKEY ADDRESS, so the command to check Maria's transaction key (from the chapter 2 example) would be:

    [wallet 433bhJ]: check_tx_key 4b540773ddf9e819f0df47708f3d3c9f7f62933150b90edc891 03d36d42ca4b7

If you are looking far a payment that has a known payment ID, you can simply specify this in the payments command, e.g.
     
     [wallet 433bhJ]: payments 12346780abcdef00 OutProofV1To53Qu2gegZbUevosKCTwrEdqiECgFyUygutXMEdh

## 8.3 Troubleshooting common problems

### 8.3.1 Problem: I transferred moneroj to my wallet, but my balance is still 0 XMR.

Available solutions:

1) [Always] Verify that you copied the correct Monero Address (sometimes malware can try to edit the copied Monero address);

2) Verify whether transaction actually arrived at your wallet / address by these steps:
A. Go to the Settings page of the GUI, and press on "Show seed & keys". Subsequently, copy the private view key.
B. Go to a blockchain explorer, such as xmrchain.net
C. Enter your transaction ID / hash.
D. Enter your private view key and address under “Decode outputs.”
E. Click on decode outputs.
F. If the result shows “output true,” it proves that the transaction was sent and recorded on the blockchain.

3) If step 2 above confirmed that the transaction occurred, then your moneroj are in the right place, but your wallet has not yet found the outputs. The Monero GUI uses a local cache that can take a few seconds to refresh, especially on Windows. If this problem persists, try to press the “Rescanning for outputs” on Monero GUI settings or try reach out through community channels for support (see chapter 6).

### 8.3.2 Problem: My GUI feels buggy / freezes all the time

First and foremost, it's important to make sure you're running the latest version. You can check the version number on the Settings page of the GUI (under Debug info). If you're not running the latest version, please upgrade first.

It is normal for the GUI to be less responsive during the initial sync process, during which the monerod daemon requires significant CPU resources to verify blocks and transactions.

You can limit monerod's CPU usage as follows:

1. Go to the Settings page of the GUI.
2. Add --max-concurrency 1 to the “daemon startup flags” field.
3. Stop the daemon and exit the GUI.
4. Restart the GUI and daemon.

The restart is necessary to restart the daemon with the new --max-concurrency flag, which configures monerod to only utilize 1 CPU thread.

## 8.4 How to add a view-only wallet

As reported in the paragraph 5.3.2.2, a view-only wallet is a special wallet which contains the private view key in order to see a sum of all transactions received and sent. This can be helpful and useful for people who want to add trasparency by permetting to others to see partially their transactions.

This tutorial assumes you have already setup a paper/cold storage wallet, and are now ready to create a "view-only" wallet in the GUI.

1. Launch Monero GUI program.
2. At landing screen, select, "Restore wallet from keys or mnemonic seed."
3. Edit your preferred "Wallet Name" and "Wallet Location"
4. Select the button "Restore from Keys"
5. Enter the Public Address for the paper/cold storage wallet you created.
6. Enter the Private View Key for the paper/cold storage wallet you created.
7. Leave the Private Spend Key field blank!
8. Enter your preferred Restore hieght or creation date. Hit next button.
9. On the next screen enter a strong password. Hit next button.
10. On the next screen select whether you want to connect via local node (recommended) or a remote node. If local, select the folder that contains your copy of the blockchain.
11. On the last screen, confirm the wallet details are correct and Open the view-only wallet!

Now you can view and confirm transactions that you've sent to your paper/cold storage wallet! If you'd like to do a test run to get familiar with the process, you may like to follow the above steps with the Monero General Fund wallet information:
